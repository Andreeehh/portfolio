# André Venâncio Ribeiro Leite de Carvalho

<p>I'm presently employed as a Java developer with proficiency in the Vaadin framework, focusing on CRM applications designed for bars, restaurants, and stores.</p>
<p>My background involves substantial experience in integrating with online ordering systems and payment machines. Furthermore, I have undertaken courses in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js, thereby creating a diverse portfolio that encompasses blogs and landing pages.</p>
<p>My journey to Ireland was driven by a linguistic student exchange aimed at refining my English language skills. Capitalizing on the GNIB opportunity, I'm actively pursuing employment opportunities in the development sector within Ireland.</p>
