# Your Name

I am presently employed as a Java developer with proficiency in the Vaadin framework, focusing on CRM applications designed for bars, restaurants, and stores. 
My background involves substantial experience in integrating with online ordering systems and payment machines. Furthermore, I have undertaken courses in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js, thereby creating a diverse portfolio that encompasses blogs and landing pages. 
My journey to Ireland was driven by a linguistic student exchange aimed at refining my English language skills. Capitalizing on the GNIB opportunity, I am actively pursuing employment opportunities in the development sector within Ireland.
